I am always looking for ways to improve Semantic Rainbow.

* Know any language with Semantic Highlighting that this theme could support better?
* Notice any contexts in which the existing syntax highlighting looks bad or incomplete?
* Are there any TextMate fallbacks or modifier combinations that should be included?

Preferably issues or fixes should be demonstrated in an example file and with info about, if applicable, extensions used to provide syntax highlighting.
