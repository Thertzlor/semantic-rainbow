# About
Plenty of themes offer minimalist highlighting focusing on specific aspects of code using a limited color palette. This theme takes the opposite approach.  
Utilizing both bold colors and subtle distinctions, anything than *can* be identified *will* be identified.

Semantic Highlighting enables an amazing amount of granular control and **Semantic Rainbow** aims to exploit all of it.

By highlighing **{baseNumber}** types of semantic tokens each with **{filterNumber}** varations corresponding to different semantic modifiers and an additional **{extraCombinationsNumber}** shades for combinations of two or more individual modifiers, this theme defines a total of **{numColors}** styles for every conceivable (and a few inconceivable) 

If you've ever wanted a visual distinction between and and a *readonly async method*, and a *readonly async method of a default library* and also want to tell it apart from a *non-async default library method*

## Background

If {numColors} styles sounds like too much to configure by hand, you're right.  
**Semantic Rainbow** is programmatically generated, based on a configuration of *base colors* for the different tokens and a list of specific *color transformations* for token modifiers which can also be stacked to represent different combinations.  
About {manualPercent}% of styles/transformations are manually defined to ensure 

## Compatibility
The expressiveness of this theme is based on VSCode's Semantic Highlighing
