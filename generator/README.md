# Working with the Semantic Theme Generator
Modifying Semantic Rainbow or generating your own dynamic semantic hightlighting theme is easy, simply edit the `config.json` file in this directory.  
But if you start from scratch, note that this generator expects to find an existing `color-theme.json` definition for all themes defined in `config.json`, as well as a `package.json` for the project in general.  
## Compiling
After making any modifications to the `config.json` file simply run `node ./generator/generate`.
The generator will apply the following changes to the color theme definition and package.json:

* The semanticTokenColors property will be fully replaced by the values generated based on the config.  
* Textmate rules defined in tokenColors will be rpelaced or modified based on the fallback definitions in the config but any unrelated TextMate rules will be left intact.  
* The static colors of your theme for the workbench and other parts of VSCode can be defined in the `colors` folder via another VSCode theme JSON file with the same name as the final output in the `themes`. Only the "colors" property will be merged into the final theme. This helps keeping manual changes to the programmatic output to a minimum.
* All other definitions in the color theme are **not** modified and can be set directly in the `themes` folder.
* The `package.json` file will be updated with the metadata of all configured themes as well as the semanticTokenScopes based on all the Theme's fallback properties.
* If the required paths are provided a number statistics can be [interpolated into your README](#readme-interpolation).

## The Style Definition Spec
Themes can be defined in the `config.json` file. The provided json schema file should provide a good enough guide on the structure, so the descriptions provided here will be more general than technical.

### **path/label/id/uiTheme**  
Theme metadata for VSCode to be inserted into `package.json`.  
See the [VSCode Contribution points documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/contribution-points#contributes.themes)
 
### **baseTokenColors**  
Each semantic token we want to style starts with a simple base color

### **modifications**
A list of color modifications that will be applied with specific token modifiers.
Each modifier needs a `default` modification and can additionally have other modifier definitions for specific token types, if the default doesn't work well with their base color for example.

The generator uses [TinyColor](https://github.com/bgrins/TinyColor) for transforming color values and most of the color modifications work as described in the [TinyColor Documentation](https://github.com/bgrins/TinyColor#color-modification) with the provided value being used as the argument. `"brighten": 10` in the JSON definition resolves to `color.brighten(10)` 

In the case of the `triad` and `tetrad` modifications the number provided in the JSON acts as an array index and decides which of the resulting values should be chosen from the method's return value.

The `alpha` modification works a bit differently than the `setAlpha` method in tinyColor which sets an absolute alpha value. `alpha` instead sets the alpha relative to the current alpha of the color so the that effect can be stacked.

A simple example of a modifier definition:
```JSON
{
   "readonly":{
      "default":{
         "darken":10
      },
      "function":{
         "darken":20
      }
   }
}
```
The above example defines that all readonly tokens will have their color darkened with by 10, but all readonly *functions* will be darkened twice as much with an amount of 20. 

### **textformatMapping**
A list token types or modifiers mapped to a text formatting definition which can take three boolean properties:  
* `bold`: tokens will be displayed in bold.
* `italic`: tokens will be displayed in italic.
* `underline`: tokens will be underlined.
* `clear`: clear any bold/itali/underline styles that other styles might have applied to this token.

### **modifierCombinations**
A list of combinations of two or more token modifiers for which stacked modifications should be generated.  
If left empty only a single modifier like `readonly` or `declaration` will be highlighted at a time, but with `readonly.declaration` defined as a modifier combination a specific style fort his configuration is generated combining the styles of both `readonly` and `declaration`.

### **alias**
A list of semantic token types mapped to a list of other semantic tokens that serve the same role.
For example Python uses the `builtin` modifier where TypeScript uses a `defaultLibrary` modifier. instead of defining the same token styles twice, `builtin` is set as an alias for `defaultLibrary`.

### **fallbacks**
A list of semantic token types with or without modifiers mapped to a list of TextMate scopes that should be highlighted in the same style.

### **mainTheme**
A boolean value indicating if a theme is the **primary** theme in a theme pack. 
Does not need to be set if there is only one theme configured.  
Only the statistics of the main theme will be used for README interpolation.

## README interpolation
The generator outputs a number of statistics about the current main theme:

* *numColors*: The total number of color styles generated.
* *baseNumber*: The number of basic semantic token types styled.
* *modNumber*: the number of modifications defined for token modifiers.
* *extraCombinationsNumber*: The number of valid modifier combinations defined.
* *manualColors*: The number of styles defined manually, this includes base colors and all modifications.
* *manualPercent*: The percentage of manually defined styles and filters in the theme compared to automated styles.

Since these numbers can fluctuate between releases and I always want up-to-date stats in my README, Semantic Rainbow includes a basic interpolation utility. Simply provide a template markdown file with any of the variable names listed above in brackets, and the variables will be filled in and saved as your finished README.  

This:
```Markdown
About {manualPercent}% of styles/transformations are manually defined
```
Becomes:
```Markdown
About 8.63% of styles/transformations are manually defined
```
[And don't worry: any links to relative paths in the Template will automatically relativized]  

To activate readme interpolation fill in the following two properties in the root of the `config.json` file:

### **readmeTemplatePath**
The path of the template README file.
### **readmePath**
The path where the README file with the interpolated value will be stored.
